For a workshop entitled "Tools for Efficient Scientific Production" aimed at master's and doctoral students in health data science with limited IT knowledge, organizing the content in a clear, interactive, and progressively complex manner is key to success. Given the 210-minute timeframe, plus a 30-minute interval, careful planning is essential to ensure each topic is covered effectively without overwhelming participants. Here's an overview of how the workshop could be structured, including time allocations and a brief description of each segment:

### Workshop Structure

**Total Time: 210 minutes + 30 minutes interval = 240 minutes**

1. **Introduction (10 minutes)**
   - Welcome and workshop overview
   - Brief introduction to each topic and its relevance to scientific production

2. **Version Control Using GitHub (30 minutes)**
   - Introduction to version control concepts (5 minutes)
   - Setting up a GitHub account and basics (10 minutes)
   - Simple text examples to demonstrate version control (15 minutes)

3. **Introduction to Markdown (20 minutes)**
   - What is Markdown and why it's useful for scientific writing (5 minutes)
   - Basic syntax and creating a document (15 minutes)
   - Briefly show integration with GitHub for version control

4. **Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) Introduction (20 minutes)**
   - Overview of PKM and its importance in research (5 minutes)
   - Basic strategies for effective PKM (15 minutes)

5. **Interval (30 minutes)**
   - A break for participants to relax and network

6. **Use of Obsidian and Connection with Zotero (40 minutes)**
   - Introduction to Obsidian for note-taking and PKM (10 minutes)
   - Connecting Obsidian with Zotero for reference management (10 minutes)
   - Hands-on examples and creating a workflow (20 minutes)

7. **Brief Presentation of Logseq Tool (20 minutes)**
   - What is Logseq and how it differs from Obsidian (5 minutes)
   - Basic features and use cases in research (15 minutes)

8. **Use of Quarto as Document Authoring and Publishing Platform (30 minutes)**
   - Introduction to Quarto and its relevance to scientific publishing (5 minutes)
   - Creating a simple document with Markdown (10 minutes)
   - Integrating references using Zotero and showing version control with GitHub (15 minutes)

9. **Wrap-Up and Q&A (20 minutes)**
   - Recap of the tools presented and their interconnectedness
   - Open floor for questions and feedback
   - Encourage collaboration among participants using GitHub

### Additional Tips:
- **Interactive Elements:** Include live demonstrations, hands-on practice, and small challenges or tasks after each major section to reinforce learning.
- **Resources:** Provide participants with access to online resources, cheat sheets, and guides for each tool discussed.
- **Collaboration:** Encourage participants to pair up or form small groups for some activities, fostering collaboration and peer learning.
- **Feedback:** Collect feedback throughout the workshop to adjust pacing and focus according to participant needs and interests.

This structure aims to balance theoretical introductions with practical applications, gradually building on each topic to illustrate the comprehensive workflow in scientific production and research. The interval allows for rest and informal discussions, which can enhance learning outcomes and participant engagement.

 For the PKM segment, emphasize the importance of effective knowledge management in research and provide practical strategies for implementation. During the interval, encourage participants to network and share their experiences with the tools discussed so far. For the Obsidian and Logseq sections, focus on demonstrating the features and benefits of each tool, allowing participants to explore and experiment with note-taking and reference management. Finally, in the Quarto segment, guide participants through the process of creating a simple document using Markdown, integrating references from Zotero, and showcasing version control with GitHub. Conclude the workshop with a recap of the interconnectedness of the tools and their relevance to scientific production, followed by an open Q&A session to address any remaining questions or concerns.


Using the above structure for the workshop, delve into the initial module (GitHub) in more detail, providing examples and hands-on exercises to reinforce learning.
